## Lock Screen

Since GNOME 3.16, GNOME Shell themes are now stored as binary files which means we need to compile the theme with the image we want.

First you need to extract the existing GNOME Shell theme to a directory. You can use the fallowing script for that:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
workdir=${HOME}
gst=/usr/share/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-theme.gresource
output_dir="${workdir}/gst"

mkdir -p "$output_dir/theme"

echo '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>' >"$output_dir/gnome-shell-theme.gresource.xml"
echo '<gresources><gresource>' >>"$output_dir/gnome-shell-theme.gresource.xml"

for r in $(gresource list $gst); do
  new_file_path="${output_dir}/${r#/org/gnome/shell/}"
  mkdir -p "$(dirname "$new_file_path")"
  gresource extract $gst "$r" > "$new_file_path"
  echo "<file>${new_file_path#$output_dir/}</file>" >> "${output_dir}/gnome-shell-theme.gresource.xml"
done

echo "<file>filename</file>" >>"$output_dir/gnome-shell-theme.gresource.xml"
echo '</gresource></gresources>' >>"$output_dir/gnome-shell-theme.gresource.xml"
```

Now there should be a folder named gst should be created in your home directory. Navigate to the created directory. You should find that the theme files have been extracted under theme folder and a file called `gnome-shell-theme.gresource.xml` we need to edit this file. Find the line that looks like `<file>filename</file>`. Replace the filename with the path to your desired image.

We also need to edit two extra files: `gnome-shell-dark.css` and `gnome-shell-light.css`. You can find them under theme folder where we extract the theme. In both file change the `#lockDialogGroup` definition as fallows:

```text
#lockDialogGroup {
  background: url(blobs-l.svg);
  background-size: cover;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: center;
}

.login-dialog {
  background-color: transparent;
}
```

Next, compile the theme using the fallowing command from the gst folder we have created:

```sh
glib-compile-resources gnome-shell-theme.gresource.xml
```

Then, copy the resulting `gnome-shell-theme.gresource` file to the `/usr/share/gnome-shell` directory. It's highly recommended to copy the old gresource file to somewhere in case if something goes wrong.

Finally, restart `gdm.service` and you should find that it is using your preferred background image. Note that you need to repeat this process each time gnome-shell package gets updated.
