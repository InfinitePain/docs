Razer drivers are not included in the base kernel so it must be integrated trough DKMS installing fallowing packages should be enough.

- linux-headers or/and linux-lts-headers
- openrazer-daemon
- polychromatic (AUR)

The GUI can be invoked using `polychromatic-controller`. There is also CLI version if needed which can is called `polychromatic-cli`. Both of them are installed with polychromatic package so no need extra installing.

User must be added to `plugdev` group in order this to function.

```bash
sudo groupadd plugdev
sudo usermod -aG plugdev emirhan
```
